### Establish a Connection with Mapbox Resources
Linking the Mapbox JavaScript library and CSS stylesheet into your HTML code is the first step in using Mapbox to generate an online map. Doing this is easy. All we have to do is open an HTML page and include the link to these resources in the <head> section. The most recent versions of the JavaScript library and CSS stylesheet can be found [here](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/guides/install/).
